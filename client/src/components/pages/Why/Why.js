          to carbontrust.com, carbon footprint is defined as the total emissions caused by an individual, event,
          organization, or product, expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent. The total amount of greenhouse gases
          produced to directly and indirectly support

          fuel which creates a certain amount of CO2, depending on its fuel consumption and the driving distance.
          (CO2 is the chemical symbol for carbon dioxide). When you heat your house with oil, gas or coal, then you
          also generate CO2. Even if you heat your house with electricity, the generation of the electrical power
          may also have emitted a certain amount of CO2. When you buy food and goods, the production of the food
          and goods also emitted some quantities of CO2.

          and reward users through points and community. Our intent is to increase recycling rates, which
          translates into measurable benefits including waste reduction, energy savings, natural resource
