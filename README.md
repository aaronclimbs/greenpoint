> The basic user story is to sign up for an account via the signup form. Upon signup, the user will be logged in and taken to a dashboard view. On the dashboard, they will see the current breakdown of their actions by category, a list of actions to add for that day, and an option to show either the weather or a selection of environmental news articles. There will also be additional resources to show where various materials can be recycled on a map and an advanced carbon footprint calculator.
